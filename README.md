#  Tutorial 1: Introduction to Git and GitHub

## Step 1: Create an account on GitHub
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) website, click Sign Up button in the top right corner. Fill out the required information including First Name, Last Name, Email
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and click Sign Up.
- Fill out the required information (name, email address, password).
- Click "Sign up" at the bottom of the page.
- Check your email to verify your account.

## Step 2: Download and install Git
- Go to [git-scm.com/downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux).
- Follow the instructions to download and install Git.

## Step 3: Configure Git
Once you have installed Git, it's time to configure it. This involves setting your username and email address which will be associated with your commits.
Once you have installed Git, it's time to configure it with some important details:

bash (MacOS / Linux):
sh $HOME/.git-installation-directory/bin/git-setup

PowerShell (Windows):
& "$HOME\.git-installation-directory\bin\git-setup.ps1"

For bash:
- When prompted for the name, enter `Your Name`.
- When asked for the email address, enter `your_email@address.com` (use your real email address).
- For both questions, press Enter.

For PowerShell:
- You will be asked to set up a credential helper. This step can be skipped by pressing N when prompted.
- The other steps are similar to those in bash.

Now that we have configured Git, let â€™s see what version we are running:
bash: `$ git --version`
PowerShell: `Get-Content env:GIT_VERSION`
